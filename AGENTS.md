# AGENTS.md — URLs-LE

Technical source of truth for this repo. README.md is the user-facing doc; this file is for anyone (human or agent) changing the code.

## What this is

A VS Code extension that extracts URLs (http/https/ftp/file/mailto/tel) from the active document (Markdown, HTML, CSS, JS/TS, JSON, YAML, Properties, TOML, INI, XML) into a results editor, with dedupe/sort post-processing. No network access — URLs are read from text, never fetched or validated.

## Architecture

```
extension.ts            activate(): createServices() -> registerCommands()
services/serviceFactory createServices(context) -> { telemetry, notifier, statusBar }
commands/               one file per command; deps injected as a frozen bag
mcp/                    MCP server: transport.ts holds the hand-rolled
                        protocol (one swap seam), tools.ts the tool table,
                        envelope.ts the normalisation boundary, fileType.ts a
                        tolerant format resolver. Imports the engine only —
                        never vscode. provider.ts is the one exception: it is
                        the VS Code side, offering the built server to agent
                        mode, and is not part of the server bundle.
extraction/extract.ts   dispatcher: languageId -> FileType -> extractor;
                        content-size cap (10MB), URL-count cap (50k), unknown
                        languages return a 'format' error
extraction/heuristics.ts  THE single URL scanner: five protocol patterns,
                        scanUrls() -> UrlMatch[], toUrls() enrichment,
                        locateParsedValues() for parser-based formats
extraction/position.ts    offset -> {line, column} via newline index (1-based)
extraction/formats/*.ts   one extractor per format; scan-based ones filter the
                        shared scan (markdown: code regions, html: comments,
                        properties: comment lines), parser-based ones
                        (json/toml/ini) walk tokens or values
ui/                     notifier (window messages, gated by notificationsLevel:
                        all -> everything, important -> warn+error, silent ->
                        error only), statusBar
utils/                  errors (sanitizeErrorMessage), safety (size guard +
                        large-file warning)
config/config.ts        getConfiguration() snapshot; CONFIG_DEFAULTS table
types.ts                shared types only — no logic
```

Outside `src/`, the root **`mcp/`** directory is the npm package `urls-le-mcp`
— manifest and README only. Its `server.js` and `LICENSE` are build output
(gitignored), copied by `scripts/build-npm.js` from the same
`dist/mcp-server.js` the VSIX ships. Do not confuse it with `src/mcp/`, which
is the source it is built from.

**One server, three distributions.** The VSIX bundles it and registers it with
agent mode; npm publishes it for `npx` and for Zed's extension shim; the MCP
registry entry points at the npm package. All three carry the same build, so
behaviour cannot diverge between hosts.

Conventions: factory functions + `Object.freeze` (no classes), guard clauses, dependency bags typed inline at the consumer — see **Code style** below. Both the manifest and the runtime strings are localized into 12 locales; see **Toolchain**.

## Code style

These are not preferences to weigh against convenience. They are the shape the
code is expected to take, and a review rejects work that ignores them. The
reason each one exists is stated, because a rule without a reason gets
cargo-culted into places it does not belong.

### Control flow

**Guard clauses first, then the work.** Every function opens with its
preconditions, each one returning immediately. The body that follows is the
happy path at a single indent level, and it reads top to bottom.

```ts
// Yes — preconditions leave, then the real work runs unindented.
function extract(document: TextDocument, config: Configuration): Result {
	if (!document) return EMPTY;
	if (!isSupported(document.languageId)) return unsupported(document.languageId);

	const text = document.getText();
	if (!text.trim()) return EMPTY;

	return runExtraction(text, config);
}
```

**No `else`. No `else if`.** An `else` is a guard clause that has not been
extracted yet. Two branches become an early return; many branches become a
lookup table or a `switch` that returns from every arm. This is the rule that
does the most work in practice — it is what keeps nesting flat, keeps diffs
small, and stops a function growing a second responsibility inside its own
`else`.

```ts
// No.
if (kind === 'hex') {
	return parseHex(value);
} else if (kind === 'rgb') {
	return parseRgb(value);
} else {
	return null;
}

// Yes — a table. Adding a format touches one line and no control flow.
const PARSERS: Readonly<Record<ColorKind, Parser>> = Object.freeze({
	hex: parseHex,
	rgb: parseRgb,
	hsl: parseHsl,
});

function parse(kind: ColorKind, value: string): Color | null {
	const parser = PARSERS[kind];
	if (!parser) return null;
	return parser(value);
}
```

**Maximum nesting is two levels inside a function.** A third level means the
inner block wants to be its own named function. Loops containing conditionals
containing conditionals are where bugs hide, because no reader holds all three
conditions at once.

**Truthy checks.** `if (!value)` rather than
`if (value === undefined || value === null || value === '')`. The exception is
real and must be respected: when `0`, `''` or `false` are legitimate values,
test explicitly (`value === undefined`, `Number.isFinite(value)`). A threshold
of `0`, an empty string that means "cleared", and `false` from `applyEdit` have
all been live bugs in this family — the terse form is the default, not a
licence to ignore the domain.

### Errors

**Every error path is handled and says something true.** A message names what
failed, why, and what state the user is now in. "Extraction failed" is not a
message; "Could not replace the document contents: the edit was rejected" is.

**Never swallow.** No empty `catch`, no `catch { return null }` that erases a
cause the caller needed, no `|| true`, no `continue-on-error`. If a failure is
genuinely ignorable, the `catch` says why in a comment.

**Failures are values where the caller must react.** A parse failure that the
user should see is reported through the callback or return value the caller
supplied — not thrown past it, and never turned into a silent empty result.
Reserve `throw` for programmer error and for unwinding to a command's outer
handler, which is the one place that decides what the user sees.

**Never report success you did not achieve.** Check what the API returned.
`vscode.workspace.applyEdit` resolves `false` for a read-only document; a
cancelled operation delivers nothing. Announcing a count over work that never
happened is the single most repeated defect in this family's history.

### Data

**Immutable by default.** `readonly` on every interface field, `ReadonlyArray`
on every collection you do not own, `Object.freeze` on returned config and
result objects. Never mutate a parameter. Build a new value and return it.
Where a mutable working copy is genuinely needed, derive the mutable type
(`type Draft<T> = { -readonly [K in keyof T]: T[K] }`) rather than
hand-maintaining a second parallel interface that drifts.

**Composition over inheritance.** Factory functions returning frozen objects,
not classes and not `extends`. Dependencies arrive as a parameter — a typed
deps bag — so a test supplies a fake without a framework. There is no
inheritance hierarchy anywhere in this fleet and there should never be one.

```ts
export function createNotifier(deps: Readonly<{ config: Configuration }>): Notifier {
	return Object.freeze({
		showInfo: (message: string) => { /* ... */ },
		showError: (message: string) => { /* ... */ },
	});
}
```

### Structure

**Logic and presentation are separate, always.** Extraction, analysis and
conversion modules compute and return data. They never call
`vscode.window.*`, never format a user-facing sentence, never decide whether a
notification is shown. `ui/` renders; `commands/` orchestrates. The test for
whether you got this right: a logic module should be unit-testable without the
`vscode` mock at all.

**Where a UI framework is involved, the same rule applies to the render.**
Compute above, return markup below. A render body holds no conditionals beyond
a trivial ternary, no data shaping, no derivation — those are named values or
functions above it. Anything else produces JSX no one can read, and it hides
the logic from the tests.

**Commands are thin.** A command reads config, calls logic, hands the result to
the UI layer, and handles failure. When a command file grows a parser or a
formatter, that code belongs in `extraction/` or `ui/`.

**No god files.** Past ~300 lines, a file is doing more than one job and wants
splitting along the seam that is already visible in its exports. `types.ts`
holds types only — no logic, ever.

**Separation of concerns, without ceremony.** One module per real concept, not
one per function. A `utils/` folder of single-line files is as unmaintainable
as a god file; both make you read the whole tree to understand one path.

**Define it once.** Duplicate regexes, duplicate `fullDocumentRange`,
duplicate "is this a supported scheme" checks — each has already shipped as a
bug in this family, because copies drift and only one copy gets fixed. When you
find yourself writing something that exists elsewhere, move it to a shared
module in the same commit.

### Comments

Comments explain **why**, never what. A comment restating the code is noise
that goes stale. A comment recording the reason a non-obvious choice was made —
the constraint, the bug it prevents, the API quirk it works around — is the
most valuable line in the file, and it is what keeps the next person from
"simplifying" it back into a defect.

## Invariants (things that were once broken — keep them true)

- **The bundle must be self-contained.** The VSIX ships `dist/extension.js` only; `scripts/check-bundle.js` (run in `vscode:prepublish` and CI) does a static require scan AND loads the bundle with `vscode` stubbed. esbuild uses `--main-fields=module,main` because jsonc-parser's UMD build smuggles `require` through a factory parameter.
- **`CONFIG_DEFAULTS` must equal package.json defaults.** `config.test.ts` asserts parity over every declared setting; add new settings to both plus the KEY_MAP in the test.
- **Every declared setting must have a consumer.** v1 shipped 18 no-op settings (of 27 declared); don't add a setting without wiring it.
- **Extractor behavior is pinned by golden snapshots** (`extraction/characterization.test.ts` + `__fixtures__/`). Any output change must update goldens in the same commit and be listed in the CHANGELOG.
- **nls catalogues stay in key-parity:** all 12 locale files carry exactly the keys of `package.nls.json`.
- **URL patterns live in one place** (`extraction/heuristics.ts`). Never re-declare the protocol regexes inside a format extractor — that is exactly how v1 ended up labeling http URLs as https in three formats.
- **All commands notify through the notifier**, so `notificationsLevel` applies uniformly; errors always show.
- **The MCP server must never reference `vscode`.** It runs in Zed, in Claude Code and from `npx`, where the import would fail in a user's session rather than in CI. `scripts/check-mcp-bundle.js` fails the build on any non-builtin require, holds the bundle under a 600 KB ceiling, and completes a real stdio handshake asserting extracted values — the SDK was rejected at 5.9 MB and without a ceiling that decision quietly rots.
- **Launching the server needs `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`.** In the extension host `process.execPath` is the editor binary, so without it the definition starts a second editor and fails silently. `scripts/e2e-vsix.js` spawns the installed server exactly as `provider.ts` does and asserts it answers.
- **Manifest placeholders are checked across every contribution point**, not just command titles. A `%key%` with no catalogue entry reaches the user as literal text; the gate in `test/integration/l10n.test.ts` walks the whole `contributes` tree.

## Toolchain

- **Runtime targets:** `engines.vscode` is the supported floor and `@types/vscode` is pinned to it **exactly**. A caret there lets the type surface drift ahead of the version users actually run, so code compiles against APIs that are not there at runtime. Dependabot is configured to never bump it.
- **Build:** esbuild bundle (`bun run build`, `build:prod` minified). `tsc` is typecheck-only (`noEmit`) and covers test files. TypeScript 7.
- **Unit tests:** vitest 4; `vscode` aliased to `src/__mocks__/vscode.ts` (stateful mock with `_reset/_set` helpers). Coverage provider `v8`, thresholds enforced at **75 lines / 80 functions / 60 branches / 75 statements**. These are a floor to ratchet upward, never to lower so a build passes.
- **Integration tests:** `bun run test:integration` — `@vscode/test-cli` launches a real VS Code (config in `.vscode-test.mjs`, tests compiled via `tsconfig.it.json` to `out-test/`). That project targets `node16` module resolution; TypeScript 7 removed `node10`, which `"Node"` resolved to.
- **Installed-VSIX tests:** `bun run test:e2e-vsix` installs the built `.vsix` into a clean VS Code profile and drives it. This is the only test that exercises the artifact users receive, and it runs in CI.
- **Lint/format:** Biome (tabs, single quotes). `__fixtures__`/`__snapshots__` are exempt — formatting fixtures would corrupt goldens. `biome.json` is byte-identical across all ten repos; change it in one and copy it to the rest.
- **Packaging:** `bun run package` → `release/*.vsix`. `.vscodeignore` is an allow-list; the VSIX is 34 files. Packaging uses `--no-dependencies`: the bundle is self-contained, so walking the npm tree served no purpose and broke after any dependency change.
- **npm package:** `bun run build:npm` assembles `mcp/` and writes its version from the root manifest, so the two can never claim the same version while carrying different code. `bun run check:npm-package` packs it, installs the tarball into a throwaway project and drives the *installed* binary through a handshake — which is what `npx` does, minus the registry. Run it before publishing: a version cannot be reused, and the unpublish window is 72 hours.
- **Localization:** two separate mechanisms. The 12 `package.nls.*.json` catalogues in `src/i18n/` localize **manifest** strings (VS Code `%key%` substitution) and are copied to the package root at prepublish, then removed by `clean:i18n`. The 12 `l10n/bundle.l10n.*.json` catalogues localize **runtime** strings via `vscode.l10n.t()`, enabled by `"l10n": "./l10n"` in package.json. They fail independently: a working manifest says nothing about the runtime bundles. The rules that keep both correct are under **Code style** above.

## Generated documentation

Two README sections are generated. Do not hand-edit the content between their markers.

- `bun run test:coverage && bun run coverage:readme` writes the Testing section from `coverage/coverage-summary.json`. CI runs `coverage:readme:check`, which fails when the committed numbers no longer match a real run — coverage is compared within 1 percentage point (it is not bit-identical across machines), while test counts are derived from source and must match exactly.
- `bun run benchmark && bun run perf:readme` writes the Performance section from a real run of the extraction entry point. This is **not** checked in CI: throughput is machine-specific, so a hosted runner would fail it for reasons that say nothing about the code. The host is printed with the numbers instead.

The pre-2.0 README carried hand-written test counts and throughput figures that drifted until they were false. Generating them is what stops that recurring.

## Security & automation

- **CodeQL** runs on push, PR and weekly (`javascript-typescript` + `actions`), configured in `.github/codeql-config.yml`. Test files and fixtures are excluded on purpose: they contain inputs that are supposed to look dangerous, and scanning them produces findings that can only ever be dismissed.
- **Dependabot** (`bun` ecosystem, not `npm` — the npm updater rewrites `package.json` without regenerating `bun.lock`, so its PRs can never pass the frozen-lockfile gate) opens grouped weekly PRs.
- **Auto-merge** is workflow-driven, not GitHub-native: `main` has no required status checks, so native auto-merge would land a PR before CI started. `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` waits for the CI run to conclude and merges only patch/minor **devDependency** updates. Runtime dependencies bundle into the shipped VSIX and always need a human.
- **Actions are pinned to commit SHAs.** A tag is mutable and this repo holds a publish token. The trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment is what Dependabot reads and rewrites.
- **Branch safety:** a `main-safety` ruleset blocks deletion and force-push. Pushes to `main` are otherwise unrestricted by design.
- Secret scanning and push protection are enabled. `VSCE_PAT` and `OVSX_PAT` live in repo secrets and in Doppler (`extensions` / `prd`).

## Agent and editor instructions

Every major coding assistant looks for its own instruction file, so each one is
present and each is a thin pointer to this document:

| File | Tool |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | the standard itself — OpenAI Codex and others read this directly |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI |
| `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules/project.mdc` | Cursor (legacy and current formats) |
| `.windsurfrules` | Windsurf |
| `.clinerules` | Cline |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot |

**Keep them thin.** They restate the non-negotiables and route the reader here;
they must never grow a second copy of the standard, because a copy drifts and
then two tools disagree about the same repository. Change the standard here,
and only the pointer's short list if a non-negotiable itself changed.

None of them ship: `.vscodeignore` is an allow-list, so the VSIX is unaffected.

## Commits

Subjects use a conventional prefix — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`,
`build:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `revert:` — an optional `(scope)`,
and an imperative summary under 72 characters with no trailing period. The body
says why the change was needed and what it prevents; a subject alone is rarely
enough to reconstruct a decision six months later.

This is enforced, not just documented:

- **`commit-msg` hook** — `bun run hooks:install` points `core.hooksPath` at
  `.githooks/`, and `prepare` runs it on install, so a fresh clone is wired
  after `bun install`. It rejects the message before the commit exists.
- **CI** — the `Commit messages` job runs the same validator over the pushed
  range. The hook is skippable with `--no-verify`; this is not, so skipping it
  delays the failure rather than avoiding it.

Both call one implementation, `scripts/commit-lint.js`, so the rules cannot
drift apart. Check a branch yourself with `bun run lint:commits`. Merge commits
are exempt — git writes those subjects, not a person. Only the commits in a
push are checked, so history predating the gate is left alone.

## Release

1. Bump `version` in package.json and write the CHANGELOG entry. The entry must describe what actually changed, including bug fixes — it ships inside the VSIX and renders on the listing page.
2. Regenerate the README sections (`coverage:readme`, and `perf:readme` if behaviour changed) and commit them.
3. CI green on all three OSes. That includes lint, typecheck, coverage, the bundle gate, packaging, integration tests, and the installed-VSIX e2e.
4. Tag the commit being released, so the tag is the artifact rather than an approximation of it.
5. Dispatch the `Release` workflow. It takes two independent opt-ins — `marketplace` (default **on**) and `openvsx` (default **off**) — because a version cannot be republished, so a run that publishes one registry and fails on the other is only recoverable by re-running with the failed target alone. It validates credentials before doing anything irreversible.

**Open VSX defaults off deliberately.** `ovsx publish` takes no namespace argument; it derives the namespace from `publisher` in the VSIX. Enabling it publishes to whatever `package.json` currently names, with no confirmation.

**The npm package ships from the same tag**, via `bun run publish:npm` (build → assemble → gate → `npm publish ./mcp --access public`). Order matters beyond this repo: npm must be published *before* any Zed registry PR merges, because Zed's shim resolves the package at runtime — a merged extension pointing at an unpublished version is broken for everyone who installs it.

## Known limitations (documented, not bugs)

- A URL ends at whitespace or any of ``< > " { } | \ ^ ` [ ] ; ) '`` — URLs containing raw spaces extract as space-terminated partials; trailing `.`/`,` are kept (legal URL characters).
- YAML and JS/TS extraction includes comments by design (a URL in a commented-out line is still discoverable); Markdown code blocks, HTML comments, and Properties comment lines are excluded.
- TOML/INI positions come from forward-locate over the source (no offsets from @iarna/toml or ini); repeated identical values resolve to successive occurrences, and values whose raw form differs from the parsed form (escape sequences) are reported without a position.
- JSON escaped URL forms (`https:\/\/…`) don't match — the scan runs over raw string tokens.
