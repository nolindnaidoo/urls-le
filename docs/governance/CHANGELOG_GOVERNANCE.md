# Changelog Governance

## Overview

This document defines the standards and guidelines for maintaining changelogs across all LE Family extensions. The goal is to create concise, scannable, and informative changelogs that provide value to users without overwhelming them.

## Core Principles

### 1. **User-Focused Content**

- Focus on user-visible changes and benefits
- Avoid technical implementation details
- Emphasize what users can do differently

### 2. **Scannable Format**

- Use clear, concise bullet points
- Group related changes logically
- Avoid walls of text

### 3. **Consistent Structure**

- Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format
- Use semantic versioning
- Maintain consistent section organization

## Changelog Structure

### Header

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to [Extension-Name] will be documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
```

## Content Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Good Changelog Entries

## Maintenance Guidelines

### 1. **Regular Reviews**

- Review changelog before each release
- Remove redundant or overly technical entries
- Ensure consistency across all LE extensions

### 2. **User Testing**

- Ask non-technical users to review changelogs
- Ensure entries are understandable without context
- Focus on "what can I do now that I couldn't before?"

### 3. **Cross-Extension Consistency**

- Use similar language and structure across all LE extensions
- Maintain consistent categorization
- Align with LE Family branding and messaging

## Enforcement

### Pre-Release Checklist

- [ ] Changelog follows this governance document
- [ ] All entries are user-focused and concise
- [ ] No technical implementation details
- [ ] Consistent formatting and structure
- [ ] Reviewed by non-technical team member

### Quality Metrics

- **Readability**: Can a user understand the change in 5 seconds?
- **Actionability**: Does the user know what they can do differently?
- **Completeness**: Are all user-visible changes documented?
- **Conciseness**: Is the changelog under 50 lines for major releases?

**Remember**: Changelogs are for users, not developers. Focus on what users care about, not how we built it.
