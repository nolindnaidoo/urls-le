# False Claims Governance

## Overview

This document establishes standards for preventing false claims in documentation, README files, changelogs, and marketing materials across all LE Family extensions. The goal is to maintain credibility, user trust, and accurate representation of our products.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Truth in Documentation**

- All claims must be verifiable and accurate
- Performance metrics must be based on actual benchmarks
- Test coverage numbers must reflect real test results
- Feature descriptions must match actual functionality

### 2. **Transparency Over Marketing**

- Honest metrics are more valuable than impressive-sounding numbers
- Users prefer accurate information over inflated claims
- Credibility is built through honesty, not exaggeration

### 3. **Regular Verification**

- Claims must be verified through testing before publication
- Documentation should be audited regularly for accuracy
- Performance metrics should be re-benchmarked with code changes

## Common False Claims to Avoid

### ❌ Performance Metrics

**False Claims Found:**

- "Millions of numbers per second" without specific benchmarks
- "4M+ numbers/sec" when actual performance is much lower
- "10,000+ URLs per second" without verification
- Vague "fast" or "lightning fast" without metrics

**✅ Correct Approach:**

- Use actual benchmarked numbers from test runs
- Include test conditions (file size, hardware, etc.)
- Update metrics when performance changes
- Be specific about what's being measured

### ❌ Test Coverage Claims

**False Claims Found:**

- "100% unit coverage" when actual coverage is much lower
- "Comprehensive coverage" without specific numbers
- "Excellent coverage" without metrics

**✅ Correct Approach:**

- Report actual coverage percentages from test runs
- Include statement, branch, function, and line coverage
- Be honest about coverage gaps
- Update numbers when tests change

### ❌ Feature Claims

**False Claims Found:**

- Claiming features that don't exist
- Overstating capabilities
- Using marketing language that doesn't match reality

**✅ Correct Approach:**

- Only claim features that are actually implemented
- Use precise, technical language
- Test all claimed functionality
- Update documentation when features change

## Verification Process

### 1. **Performance Metrics Verification**

Before publishing performance claims:

1. **Run actual benchmarks** on representative hardware
2. **Use realistic test data** that matches real-world usage
3. **Document test conditions** (file sizes, hardware specs, etc.)
4. **Update metrics regularly** as code changes
5. **Be conservative** in estimates

**Example Verification:**

```bash
# Run performance tests
bun run test:performance

# Verify results match documentation
# Update README with actual numbers
```

### 2. **Test Coverage Verification**

Before publishing coverage claims:

1. **Run coverage tests** with current codebase
2. **Verify all test numbers** are accurate
3. **Include all coverage types** (statements, branches, functions, lines)
4. **Update when tests change**
5. **Be honest about gaps**

**Example Verification:**

```bash
# Run coverage tests
bun run test:coverage

# Verify numbers match documentation
# Update README with actual coverage
```

### 3. **Feature Verification**

Before publishing feature claims:

1. **Test all claimed functionality**
2. **Verify implementation completeness**
3. **Check edge cases and limitations**
4. **Update when features change**
5. **Document known limitations**

## Current Issues Found

### EnvSync-LE

- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Claims 79.04% coverage - **VERIFIED** (actual: 78.74%)
- ✅ **Performance**: Claims are reasonable and not inflated

### Numbers-LE

- ❌ **Test Coverage**: Claims 36.58% coverage - **VERIFIED** (actual: 32.73%)
- ❌ **Performance**: Claims "4M+ numbers/sec" - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
- ❌ **Test Count**: Claims 182 tests - **VERIFIED** (actual: 151 tests)

### Paths-LE

- ❌ **Test Coverage**: Claims 38.74% coverage - **VERIFIED** (actual: 36.03%)
- ❌ **Test Count**: Claims 220 tests - **VERIFIED** (actual: 204 tests)
- ❌ **Performance**: Claims "980K+ paths/sec" - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**

### Scrape-LE

- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Claims 82.17% coverage - **VERIFIED** (actual: 82.17%)
- ✅ **Test Count**: Claims 121 tests - **VERIFIED** (actual: 121 tests)

### String-LE

- ❌ **Test Coverage**: Claims "comprehensive coverage" - **VERIFIED** (actual: 50.45%)
- ❌ **Test Count**: Claims 137 tests - **VERIFIED** (actual: 128 tests)
- ❌ **Performance**: Claims "1.8M+ lines/sec" - **VERIFIED** (actual: 1,186,370 lines/sec - close but not exact)

### URLs-LE

- ❌ **Test Coverage**: No specific claims made - **GOOD**
- ❌ **Test Count**: Claims 200 tests - **VERIFIED** (actual: 149 tests)
- ❌ **Performance**: Claims "10,000+ URLs per second" - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**

## Changelog Compliance Issues

### Violations of Changelog Governance

Several changelogs violate the governance document by including:

1. **Technical Implementation Details**

   - "Implemented service factory pattern with dependency injection"
   - "Added comprehensive validation system with security checks"
   - "Enhanced TypeScript usage with strict mode compliance"

2. **Internal Metrics**

   - "Increased from 7 to 18 test files (157% improvement)"
   - "61 TypeScript files - Highest in LE Family"
   - "200 passing tests across 18 test suites"

3. **Overly Verbose Entries**
   - Long paragraphs explaining implementation details
   - Repetitive bullet points
   - Excessive technical jargon

## Enforcement Guidelines

### 1. **Pre-Release Checklist**

Before each release, verify:

- [ ] All performance metrics are benchmarked and accurate
- [ ] Test coverage numbers match actual test runs
- [ ] Feature claims are verified through testing
- [ ] Changelog follows governance document
- [ ] No false or inflated claims exist

### 2. **Regular Audits**

Conduct quarterly audits:

- [ ] Run all performance benchmarks
- [ ] Verify all test coverage numbers
- [ ] Check feature claims against implementation
- [ ] Review changelog compliance
- [ ] Update documentation with accurate numbers

### 3. **Correction Process**

When false claims are found:

1. **Immediate correction** of false information
2. **Update all affected documentation**
3. **Add verification steps** to prevent recurrence
4. **Document the correction** in changelog
5. **Review process** to prevent similar issues

## Quality Metrics

### Accuracy Standards

- **Performance Metrics**: Must be within 10% of actual benchmarks
- **Test Coverage**: Must match actual coverage within 1%
- **Test Counts**: Must be exactly accurate
- **Feature Claims**: Must be 100% verifiable

### Documentation Standards

- **Specific over vague**: "1,186,370 lines/sec" not "fast"
- **Measured over estimated**: Use actual benchmarks, not guesses
- **Current over outdated**: Update metrics with code changes
- **Honest over impressive**: Credibility over marketing appeal

## Tools and Automation

### Automated Verification

```bash
# Verify test coverage claims
bun run test:coverage
grep -r "coverage" README.md
# Compare numbers

# Verify performance claims
bun run test:performance
# Compare with documentation

# Verify test counts
bun run test | grep "Tests"
# Compare with documentation
```

### Documentation Templates

Use standardized templates for:

- Performance metrics with test conditions
- Test coverage with all coverage types
- Feature descriptions with limitations
- Changelog entries following governance

## Consequences

### For False Claims

1. **Immediate correction** required
2. **Documentation review** of all affected files
3. **Process improvement** to prevent recurrence
4. **Team notification** of the issue and correction

### For Repeated Violations

1. **Enhanced review process** for affected projects
2. **Additional verification steps** before releases
3. **Team training** on accurate documentation
4. **Escalation** to project leads

## Success Metrics

### Quality Indicators

- **Zero false claims** in documentation
- **100% verified** performance metrics
