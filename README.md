## What it does

Open a file, run `URLs-LE: Extract URLs`, and every URL in the document lands in a new editor — deduplicate and sort it from there. Works in VS Code and in VS Code–based editors like Cursor and VSCodium (installable from Open VSX).

- **Link auditing** — every link, autolink, and plain URL in Markdown and HTML (code blocks and comments excluded)
- **Source review** — URLs in string literals, template literals, and comments across JS/TS
- **Config sweep** — URLs in JSON strings, YAML values, Java properties, TOML/INI values, and XML (Maven POMs, feeds)

## Install

| Where | What you get | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **VS Code** | The extraction, in your editor, on a keystroke | [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nolindnaidoo.urls-le) |
| **Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf** | The same extension | [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nolindnaidoo/urls-le) |
| **A terminal or a CI step** | The same run over a whole tree, with exit codes | `cargo install urls-le` · [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/urls-le) |
| **Any MCP agent, via Node** | `extract_urls` over stdio | `npx urls-le-mcp` · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urls-le-mcp) |

## Use it from an AI agent

The same extraction engine runs as an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so an agent can call it directly instead of you running a command.

| Editor | How |
|---|---|
| **VS Code** 1.101+ | Nothing to install — the extension registers `extract_urls` with agent mode |
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp add urls-le -- npx -y urls-le-mcp` |
| **Cursor, Windsurf, anything else** | point it at `npx urls-le-mcp` |

```
extract_urls(content, format?, filename?, dedupe?, maxResults?)
```

Returns every URL with its protocol and 1-based line and column, capped at 500 by default with `meta.truncated` so a large file cannot flood the agent's context window.

The server takes content and returns data — it reads no files and makes no network requests of its own. Published as [`urls-le-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urls-le-mcp) on npm and as `io.github.nolindnaidoo/urls-le` in the [MCP registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io).

<details>
<summary><b>Configuring it by hand</b> — any host with an MCP config file</summary>

Most hosts read a JSON config. Add one entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "urls-le": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "urls-le-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

`-y` skips the install prompt on first run. Pin a version if you would rather not track releases — `urls-le-mcp@2.4.0`.

Prefer not to go through `npx` on every launch? Install it once and point at the binary instead:

```bash
npm install -g urls-le-mcp
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "urls-le": { "command": "urls-le-mcp" }
  }
}
```

It speaks MCP over stdio and needs no environment variables, no API key and no configuration of its own. To check it before wiring it into anything:

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | npx -y urls-le-mcp
```

That prints the tool list and exits — if you see `extract_urls`, the server works.

</details>

## Across a folder or a workspace

Extract reads the document you have open. A scan reads many files from disk and gives one report.

- **The whole workspace**: run `URLs-LE: Extract URLs from Workspace` from the command palette.
- **One folder**: right-click it in the Explorer and choose `Extract URLs from Folder`, or run `URLs-LE: Extract URLs from Folder` and pick one.

A project writes the same URL in many places, so the report is the distinct URLs, the most widely used first, with how often each is written and where:

```markdown
# URLs-LE workspace report

`my-project` · 3 file(s) read · 2 distinct URL(s), 5 occurrence(s) in 3 file(s)

| URL | Occurrences | Files |
|---|---|---|
| `https://example.com/docs` | 3 | 2 |
| `https://api.example.com/v1` | 2 | 2 |

## `https://example.com/docs` (3)

- `config.json` · **2:12**
- `docs/a.md` · **1:5**, **1:34**

## `https://api.example.com/v1` (2)

- `docs/a.md` · **2:6**
- `src/b.ts` · **1:14**
```

That is with `urls-le.showPositions` on. It is off by default, and then each line is the file and how many times the URL is in it: `docs/a.md (2)`. The copy on the clipboard follows `urls-le.clipboardIncludesPositions`, as it does for Extract.

**What a scan reads.** Files come from disk, so an unsaved edit is not seen. A file over the safety size, or one that is not UTF-8 text, is left unread. It stops at 5,000 files or 10,000 listed occurrences. The report ends with a line for each thing it left out, so a short report is never mistaken for a clean project.

**What it skips, and how to change that.** Three switches are on by default, and each can be turned off on its own in Settings:

| Switch | Skips |
|---|---|
| `scanUseDefaultExcludes` | Dependency folders, build output, tool caches and lockfiles. The full list is below |
| `scanRespectGitignore` | Whatever the project's `.gitignore` files skip |
| `scanSkipBinaryFiles` | Images, fonts, archives and other files that are not text |

Two lists adjust the result without turning a switch off. To skip more, add a pattern to `scanExcludes`. To read something a switch would skip, add it to `scanAlwaysInclude`:

```jsonc
{
	// Also skip the test fixtures.
	"urls-le.workspace.scanExcludes": ["**/fixtures/**"],
	// Read the vendored code, though the built-in list skips it.
	"urls-le.workspace.scanAlwaysInclude": ["**/vendor/**"]
}
```

`URLs-LE: Open Settings` opens all of these in the Settings editor.

<details>
<summary>The built-in list</summary>

Folders, wherever they appear:

<!-- built-in-folders -->
`.git`, `.hg`, `.svn`, `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `jspm_packages`, `.pnpm-store`, `.yarn`, `vendor`, `site-packages`, `Pods`, `Carthage`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `target`, `_build`, `_site`, `dist-newstyle`, `zig-out`, `storybook-static`, `cdk.out`, `DerivedData`, `CMakeFiles`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `.output`, `.svelte-kit`, `.angular`, `.astro`, `.docusaurus`, `.vuepress`, `.expo`, `.turbo`, `.parcel-cache`, `.cache`, `.sass-cache`, `.jekyll-cache`, `.dart_tool`, `.pub-cache`, `.gradle`, `.kotlin`, `.cxx`, `.externalNativeBuild`, `captures`, `ephemeral`, `.symlinks`, `.swiftpm`, `.build`, `.bundle`, `.stack-work`, `.zig-cache`, `.godot`, `elm-stuff`, `.vercel`, `.netlify`, `.serverless`, `.aws-sam`, `.terraform`, `.venv`, `venv`, `__pycache__`, `.tox`, `.nox`, `.mypy_cache`, `.pytest_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `.ipynb_checkpoints`, `.eggs`, `coverage`, `htmlcov`, `.nyc_output`, `.vscode-test`, `.idea`, `.vs`, `xcuserdata`, `*.egg-info`
<!-- /built-in-folders -->

Files, wherever they appear:

<!-- built-in-files -->
`*.min.js`, `*.min.css`, `*.map`, `*.snap`, `*.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `go.sum`, `*.pbxproj`, `*.iml`, `local.properties`, `output-metadata.json`, `.flutter-plugins`, `.flutter-plugins-dependencies`, `.packages`, `Generated.xcconfig`, `flutter_export_environment.sh`, `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.*`, `fastlane/report.xml`, `fastlane/test_output/**`, `doc/api/**`
<!-- /built-in-files -->

Not on the list, because they are ordinary folders in many projects: `bin`, `obj`, `tmp`, `logs`, `public`, `generated`. A project that generates those ignores them in git, and the scan reads `.gitignore`.

</details>

The settings that shape a scan are under [Settings](#settings).

## The CLI

The same extraction runs from a terminal or a shell pipeline: a Rust CLI
in [`crate/`](crate/README.md), sharing one corpus with the extension —
[`crate/fixtures/`](crate/fixtures/) — so the two can never read a
document differently.

```bash
urls-le .                     # every URL in the tree
urls-le --dedupe docs/        # one line per distinct URL
urls-le mcp                   # the same extraction over MCP on stdio

# the point of the whole thing:
urls-le . | jq -r '.urls[].value' | sort -u | lychee -
```

**Exit codes follow grep** — 0 URLs found, 1 none found, 2 the question
was malformed — so `if urls-le src/; then …` works and finding nothing
is an answer rather than an error.

**It has no opinions, deliberately.** No link checking, no
insecure-scheme flag, no filtering. An `http://` URL is wrong in a
production config and right in a test fixture; a tool that decides for
you is one you configure, then argue with, then mute — and the muting
takes the extraction with it. Pipe it to `lychee` and let that have the
opinions.

## Supported formats

| Format | Language IDs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown | `markdown` | Fenced code blocks and inline code excluded |
| HTML | `html` | `<!-- -->` comments excluded (multi-line supported) |
| CSS | `css` | Quoted or bare `url(...)`, `@import` |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `javascript`, `typescript` | Strings, template literals, comments |
| JSON | `json` | String literals only, via jsonc-parser token offsets; comments are trivia |
| YAML | `yaml` | Whole content, comments included |
| Properties | `properties` | `#`/`!` comment lines excluded |
| TOML | `toml` | Parsed values only; comments excluded |
| INI | `ini` | Whole content; `;`/`#` comment lines excluded |
| XML | `xml` | Attributes and text content |
| Anything else | any | Whole document scanned; `fileType` reports `unknown` |

**No document is refused.** The eleven above know what to exclude; every
other language id — `python`, `go`, `shellscript`, `csv`, `plaintext`,
`log`, whatever your editor calls it — is scanned whole, because a URL is
unambiguous in any text and there is nothing in those worth excluding.

Extracted protocols: `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `file`, `mailto` (requires an `@`), `tel`. Every occurrence is reported with its real line and column — TOML positions are forward-located in the source and can be approximate for repeated identical values. A URL ends at whitespace or a quote/bracket delimiter, so relative links (`/docs`) and bare domains (`example.com`) are never extracted, and URLs containing raw spaces extract as space-terminated partials. Trailing `.`/`,` are kept — they are legal URL characters.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `URLs-LE: Extract URLs` | Extract all URLs from the active document |
| `URLs-LE: Extract URLs from Workspace` | The distinct URLs in every file in the workspace, and where each one is |

## Languages

Twelve languages besides English:

German · Spanish · French · Indonesian · Italian · Japanese · Korean ·
Portuguese (Brazil) · Russian · Ukrainian · Vietnamese · Chinese (Simplified)

Both halves are covered — the manifest (command titles, setting names and
descriptions) and everything shown while the extension runs (notifications,
the status bar, the sort quick-pick). The extension follows VS Code's display
language, so it matches whatever the editor is already set to; no setting of
its own.

## Privacy & security

- **No network access.** The extension never fetches, validates, or pings the URLs it extracts — it only reads the text of the active document. The `telemetryEnabled` setting writes events to a local Output Channel you can inspect (`URLs-LE Telemetry`); nothing leaves your machine.
- **The MCP server holds the same line.** It takes content as an argument and returns data: no filesystem access, no network calls, no telemetry. Your agent already has file-read tools, so duplicating them inside the server would add a path-traversal surface for no capability. `check:mcp-bundle` fails the build if the server ever imports something that could reach either.
- Error notifications redact home directories and credential-shaped fragments.
- **One rating prompt, at most twice.** After 10 successful uses across 3 separate days the extension asks once whether you would rate it, and once more 30 uses later if you chose *Later* or dismissed it. *Don't Ask Again* ends it. Setting `notificationsLevel` to `important` or `silent` yourself turns it off. The counts are kept in VS Code's extension storage and nothing is sent anywhere; *Rate* opens the listing you installed from — the VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX — in your browser.

## Performance

<!-- performance:start -->
| Input | Size | Found | Time | Rate | Scan speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Markdown docs | 2.63 MB | 50,000 | 61.14 ms | 817,802/sec | 43 MB/s |
| HTML page | 1.25 MB | 30,000 | 21.88 ms | 1,370,972/sec | 57 MB/s |
| JSON config | 1.52 MB | 40,000 | 39.01 ms | 1,025,358/sec | 38.8 MB/s |

Median of 7 runs after warmup, on Apple M5 Pro, 24 GB RAM, Node 24.3.0. Inputs are generated
by `scripts/benchmark.ts` rather than checked in, so the sizes above are
exactly what was measured. Reproduce with `bun run benchmark`.

These are machine-specific and are not asserted in CI — a benchmark that gates
a build only tells you how busy the runner was.
<!-- performance:end -->

## Testing

<!-- coverage:start -->
| Metric | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Statements | 94.73% |
| Branches | 85.98% |
| Functions | 95.92% |
| Lines | 95.53% |

395 test cases across 28 files, plus an integration suite that runs
in a real VS Code extension host and an end-to-end test that installs the
built `.vsix` into a clean profile.

Generated from a real run — `coverage/coverage-summary.json` and
`coverage/test-results.json` — by `scripts/coverage-readme.js`; CI fails if
this section drifts. Reproduce with `bun run test:coverage`, and the case
count is the one vitest prints.
