//! JavaScript's string primitives, where Rust's differ.
//!
//! The extension calls `String.prototype.trim` and matches `\s` in the
//! shared scanner. Neither means what the Rust equivalent means:
//! JavaScript's whitespace set includes U+FEFF, which Unicode's
//! `White_Space` property does not, and excludes U+0085, which it does.
//! A file beginning with a byte-order mark is ordinary, so the
//! difference is reachable rather than theoretical — and it reached
//! every extractor here at once. `format: "\u{feff}json"` resolved to
//! two different formats, a BOM mid-URL ended the match on one server
//! and not the other, and a fence or a comment behind one was a fence or
//! a comment on one server only.
//!
//! Defining the set once, in two forms, and testing that the two agree
//! is the only way this stays correct — a character added to one form
//! and not the other is exactly the drift this guards against.
//!
//! Held to the same shape and the same names as the sibling crates that
//! hit this first. Where they agree it is because the same answer was
//! right twice.

/// `LineTerminator` from the language spec.
