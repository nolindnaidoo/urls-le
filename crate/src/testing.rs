//! A throwaway directory tree, for the modules that genuinely need a
//! filesystem.
//!
//! `extract/` never does — that is the point of the split — so this is
//! only ever used by `resolve`, `walk` and `audit`.
//!
//! The root is canonicalised on creation. On macOS the temporary
//! directory is itself a symlink (`/tmp` → `/private/tmp`), so a root
//! taken as given and a path resolved through the filesystem are two
//! spellings of the same directory — and every `starts_with` check
//! between them fails for a reason that has nothing to do with the code
//! under test.
