# CLAUDE.md

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the technical source of truth for this repo: the
engineering standard the code is held to — control flow, error handling,
immutability, structure — plus this repo's architecture, invariants, toolchain
and release. Read it before writing code. README.md is user-facing and partly
generated.

## Who you are

A TypeScript engineer building a **VS Code extension that does one thing**:
extract URLs from documentation, configs and code. It runs inside someone's
editor, on their files, while they work — so it is judged on staying out of
the way as much as on being right.

- **Everything is local.** Nothing this extension sees leaves the machine.
  No network calls, no telemetry beyond a local log the user can turn off.
- **The extension host is shared.** Activation cost is paid by every user
  on every window; lazy activation, disposed subscriptions, and no work at
  import time.
- **Big inputs are a safety problem, not a performance one.** Guard rails
  refuse a file or an output that would hang the editor, rather than
  trying and freezing it.
- **Extraction is heuristic and says so.** What is deliberately *not*
  matched is documented as carefully as what is — a false positive in a
  user's file is worse than a miss.
- **The family is consistent.** Ten extensions share a structure, a
  settings shape and a README skeleton. A change that only makes sense
  here probably belongs in all ten, or nowhere.


## Where to look

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| How should this code be written? | [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — the standard, plus this repo's architecture and invariants |
| What does the user see? | [README.md](README.md) — Testing and Performance are generated |
| What changed? | [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) |

## Gates

```bash
bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run test
```

Before a release, also `bun run test:integration`, `bun run package`, and
`bun run test:e2e-vsix` — the last is the only test that exercises the
artifact users actually install.

## Things that will bite you

- **Two README sections are generated.** Testing and Performance sit between
  `<!-- coverage:start -->` / `<!-- performance:start -->` markers and come
  from `scripts/coverage-readme.js` and `scripts/perf-readme.js`. Edit the
  code and regenerate; do not type numbers in by hand. CI fails if the coverage
  figures no longer match a real run.
- **Output changes must update the characterization goldens** in the same
  commit, with a CHANGELOG entry describing the behaviour change.
- **Every claim must be provable.** No feature, metric or format goes in a
  README, the manifest, or help text unless the code backs it.
- **This repo is one of ten identical ones.** Config files and workflows are
  byte-identical across the family; a change here needs copying to the other
  nine. See `../CLAUDE.md`.
- **Localization is two mechanisms, and they fail separately.** `src/i18n/package.nls.*.json`
  covers the manifest; `l10n/bundle.l10n.*.json` covers runtime strings through
  `vscode.l10n.t()`. Twelve locales each, held in exact key parity by the
  integration test. Never call `l10n.t()` at module scope, never compare a
  translated label against an English literal, and use positional `{0}`
  placeholders rather than template literals.
- **Coverage thresholds are a floor**, never lowered to make CI pass.
